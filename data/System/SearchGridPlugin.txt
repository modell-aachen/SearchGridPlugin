---++ Solr Proxy
The plugin adds a 'REST proxy' which will forward the solr request to the solr plugin and processe the answer that are the main display values are added. For fields which have an displayvalue like Select+value fields. The result set gets an extra field with prefix =_dv=. So for a =field_Status_s= there is also a =field_Status_s_dv= which is the mapped value of the field_Status_s field.

The REST calls can be send to:
=/bin/rest/SearchGridPlugin/searchproxy=
